      How much can change in a year? I can tell you this, my name isn't Camden Keating. My face isn't my face.
      
      I have a history with this town, but not a soul remembers me. 
      
      I was once a best friend of many. Now I separate myself from everyone.
      
      Lei Falls is not the town I thought it was growing up. The past year has taught me that.

      a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked 
      over one another in the canteen. The plate

      removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed 
      at the bottommost position remains in the 
      stack for the longest period of time. So, it 
      can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In 
      First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.`,
